tif22pnm is a command line utility that converts between TIFF sampled images
and PNM images (both directions), using the libtiff library, but not using
NetPBM. tif22pnm is similar to tifftopnm utility in the NetPBM distribution,
but tif22pnm handles a wider range of TIFF files and it is able to output
the alpha channel as a PBM or PGM file.

Caveat: tiff2pnm v0.07 contains >1000 lines of untested code. The author
wants to improve the software, and he welcomes bug reports. The author has
tested v0.07 with around 20 very different input files, and it worked. More
thorough testing seems to be necessary.

Unique advantages (over any other TIFF to PNM converter):

-- handles all kinds of compressed TIFF files libtiff can cope with
   (tifftopnm doesn't)
-- handles all kinds of compressed TIFF files GIMP 1.3 can cope with, plus
   more (tifftopnm, GIMP 1.3 doesn't)
-- handles all kinds of color spaces libtiff can cope with
   (tifftopnm doesn't)
-- handles TIFF/JPEG input files correctly (tifftopnm doesn't, GIMP 1.0 
   doesn't, xv doesn't, ImageMagick doesn't, GIMP 1.3 does)
-- automatically writes a smaller file (PBM < PGM < PPM) if image pixels
   make it possible

Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~
	./configure
	./do.sh compile

Goal
~~~~
The author wants tif22pnm to be able to read a vide range of image formats
(not just TIFF and PNM), including corrupted image files. In the future
tif22pnm should support many output formats, but only few compression
methods. If you want tight output and full PostScript and PDF support,
please try sam2p:

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
As root,

	cp tif22pnm /usr/local/bin

Usage
~~~~~
	$ tiff2pnm
	This is tif22pnm v0.07: TIFF <-> PNM converter, by pts@fazekas.hu
